The Forward Euler method is a first-order numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value.

Given an initial value problem of the form

$$
y'(t) = f(t, y(t))
$$

with initial condition

$$
y(t_0)=y_0
$$

then for a given step size $\Delta t$, we say that $t_n = t_0 + n\Delta t$, and the approximate solution is given by

$$
y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \Delta t f(t_n, y(t_n))
$$

etc.
